abstract="The IoT is a network of interconnected everyday objects called ``things'' that have been augmented with a small measure of computing capabilities. Lately, the IoT has been affected by a variety of different botnet activities. As botnets have been the cause of serious security risks and financial damage over the years, existing Network forensic techniques cannot identify and track current sophisticated methods of botnets. This is because commercial tools mainly depend on signature-based approaches that cannot discover new forms of botnet. In literature, several studies have conducted the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in order to train and validate a model for defining such attacks, but they still produce high false alarm rates with the challenge of investigating the tracks of botnets. This paper investigates the role of ML techniques for developing a Network forensic mechanism based on network flow identifiers that can track suspicious activities of botnets. The experimental results using the UNSW-NB15 dataset revealed that ML techniques with flow identifiers can effectively and efficiently detect botnets' attacks and their tracks.",

abstract = {With the prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, inconspicuous everyday household devices are connected to the Internet, providing automation and real-time services to their users. In spite of their light-weight design and low power, their vulnerabilities often give rise to cyber risks that harm their operations over network systems. One of the key challenges of securing IoT networks is tracing sources of cyber-attack events, along with obfuscating and encrypting network traffic. This study proposes a new network forensics framework , called a Particle Deep Framework (PDF), which describes the digital investigation phases for identifying and tracing attack behaviors in IoT networks. The proposed framework includes three new functions: (1) extracting network data flows and verifying their integrity to deal with encrypted networks; (2) utilizing a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to automatically adapt parameters of deep learning; and (3) developing a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on the PSO algorithm to discover and trace abnormal events from IoT network of smart homes. The proposed PDF is evaluated using the Bot-IoT and UNSW_NB15 datasets and compared with various deep learning techniques. Experimental results reveal a high performance of the proposed framework for discovering and tracing cyber-attack events compared with the other techniques.}

abstract = {While there has been a significant interest in understanding the cyber threat landscape of Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and the design of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based security approaches, there is a lack of distributed architecture led to generating heterogeneous datasets that contain the actual behaviors of real-world IoT networks and complex cyber threat scenarios to evaluate the credibility of the new systems. This paper presents a novel testbed architecture of IoT network which can be used to evaluate Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based security applications. The platform NSX vCloud NFV was employed to facilitate the execution of Software-Defined Network (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Service Orchestration (SO) to offer dynamic testbed networks, which allow the interaction of edge, fog and cloud tiers. While deploying the architecture, real-world normal and attack scenarios are executed to collect labeled datasets. The generated datasets are named ‚ÄòTON_IoT‚Äô, as they comprise heterogeneous data sources collected from telemetry datasets of IoT services, Windows and Linux-based datasets, and datasets of network traffic. The TON_IoT network dataset is validated using four machine learning-based intrusion detection algorithms of Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Deep Neural Networks, revealing a high performance of detection accuracy using the set of training and testing. A comparative summary of the TON_IoT network dataset and other competing network datasets demonstrates its diverse legitimate and anomalous patterns that can be used to better validate new AI-based security solutions. The architecture and datasets can be publicly accessed from TON_IOT Datasets (2020).}

abstract = {The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, has enabled transforming urban areas into smart cities. Smart cities‚Äô paradigm has resulted in improved quality of life and better services to citizens, like smart healthcare, smart parking, smart transport, smart buildings, smart homes, and so on. One of the major challenges of IoT devices is the limited capacity of their battery because the devices consume a large amount of energy once they communicate with each other. Furthermore, the IoT-based smart systems would contain sensitive data about network systems, introducing serious privacy and security issues. IoT-based smart systems are highly exposed to botnet attacks. Examples of such attacks are Mirai and BASHLITE malware launched from compromised surveillance devices, which are common in smart cities, resulting in paralysis of Internet-based services through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Such DDoS attacks on IoT devices and their networks further threaten the emerging concept of sustainable smart cities. To discover such cyberattacks, this paper proposes a novel statistical learning-based botnet detection framework, called IoTBoT-IDS, which protects IoT-based smart networks against botnet attacks. IoTBoT-IDS captures the normal behavior of IoT networks by applying statistical learning-based techniques, using Beta Mixture Model (BMM) and a Correntropy model. Any deviation from the normal behavior is detected as an anomalous event. To evaluate IoTBoT-IDS, three benchmark datasets generated from realistic IoT networks were used. The evaluation results showed that IoTBoT-IDS effectively identifies various types of botnets with an average detection accuracy of 99.2%, which is higher by about 2‚Äì5% compared with compelling intrusion detection methods, namely AdaBoost ensemble learning, fuzzy c-means, and deep feed forward neural networks.}
