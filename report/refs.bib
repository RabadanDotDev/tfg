abstract="The IoT is a network of interconnected everyday objects called ``things'' that have been augmented with a small measure of computing capabilities. Lately, the IoT has been affected by a variety of different botnet activities. As botnets have been the cause of serious security risks and financial damage over the years, existing Network forensic techniques cannot identify and track current sophisticated methods of botnets. This is because commercial tools mainly depend on signature-based approaches that cannot discover new forms of botnet. In literature, several studies have conducted the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in order to train and validate a model for defining such attacks, but they still produce high false alarm rates with the challenge of investigating the tracks of botnets. This paper investigates the role of ML techniques for developing a Network forensic mechanism based on network flow identifiers that can track suspicious activities of botnets. The experimental results using the UNSW-NB15 dataset revealed that ML techniques with flow identifiers can effectively and efficiently detect botnets' attacks and their tracks.",

abstract = {With the prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, inconspicuous everyday household devices are connected to the Internet, providing automation and real-time services to their users. In spite of their light-weight design and low power, their vulnerabilities often give rise to cyber risks that harm their operations over network systems. One of the key challenges of securing IoT networks is tracing sources of cyber-attack events, along with obfuscating and encrypting network traffic. This study proposes a new network forensics framework , called a Particle Deep Framework (PDF), which describes the digital investigation phases for identifying and tracing attack behaviors in IoT networks. The proposed framework includes three new functions: (1) extracting network data flows and verifying their integrity to deal with encrypted networks; (2) utilizing a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to automatically adapt parameters of deep learning; and (3) developing a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on the PSO algorithm to discover and trace abnormal events from IoT network of smart homes. The proposed PDF is evaluated using the Bot-IoT and UNSW_NB15 datasets and compared with various deep learning techniques. Experimental results reveal a high performance of the proposed framework for discovering and tracing cyber-attack events compared with the other techniques.}

abstract = {While there has been a significant interest in understanding the cyber threat landscape of Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and the design of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based security approaches, there is a lack of distributed architecture led to generating heterogeneous datasets that contain the actual behaviors of real-world IoT networks and complex cyber threat scenarios to evaluate the credibility of the new systems. This paper presents a novel testbed architecture of IoT network which can be used to evaluate Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based security applications. The platform NSX vCloud NFV was employed to facilitate the execution of Software-Defined Network (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Service Orchestration (SO) to offer dynamic testbed networks, which allow the interaction of edge, fog and cloud tiers. While deploying the architecture, real-world normal and attack scenarios are executed to collect labeled datasets. The generated datasets are named ‘TON_IoT’, as they comprise heterogeneous data sources collected from telemetry datasets of IoT services, Windows and Linux-based datasets, and datasets of network traffic. The TON_IoT network dataset is validated using four machine learning-based intrusion detection algorithms of Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Deep Neural Networks, revealing a high performance of detection accuracy using the set of training and testing. A comparative summary of the TON_IoT network dataset and other competing network datasets demonstrates its diverse legitimate and anomalous patterns that can be used to better validate new AI-based security solutions. The architecture and datasets can be publicly accessed from TON_IOT Datasets (2020).}

abstract = {The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, has enabled transforming urban areas into smart cities. Smart cities’ paradigm has resulted in improved quality of life and better services to citizens, like smart healthcare, smart parking, smart transport, smart buildings, smart homes, and so on. One of the major challenges of IoT devices is the limited capacity of their battery because the devices consume a large amount of energy once they communicate with each other. Furthermore, the IoT-based smart systems would contain sensitive data about network systems, introducing serious privacy and security issues. IoT-based smart systems are highly exposed to botnet attacks. Examples of such attacks are Mirai and BASHLITE malware launched from compromised surveillance devices, which are common in smart cities, resulting in paralysis of Internet-based services through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Such DDoS attacks on IoT devices and their networks further threaten the emerging concept of sustainable smart cities. To discover such cyberattacks, this paper proposes a novel statistical learning-based botnet detection framework, called IoTBoT-IDS, which protects IoT-based smart networks against botnet attacks. IoTBoT-IDS captures the normal behavior of IoT networks by applying statistical learning-based techniques, using Beta Mixture Model (BMM) and a Correntropy model. Any deviation from the normal behavior is detected as an anomalous event. To evaluate IoTBoT-IDS, three benchmark datasets generated from realistic IoT networks were used. The evaluation results showed that IoTBoT-IDS effectively identifies various types of botnets with an average detection accuracy of 99.2%, which is higher by about 2–5% compared with compelling intrusion detection methods, namely AdaBoost ensemble learning, fuzzy c-means, and deep feed forward neural networks.}

abstract="An intrusion detection system has become a vital mechanism to detect a wide variety of malicious activities in the cyber domain. However, this system still faces an important limitation when it comes to detecting zero-day attacks, concerning the reduction of relatively high false alarm rates. It is thus necessary to no longer consider the tasks of monitoring and analysing network data in isolation, but instead optimise their integration with decision-making methods for identifying anomalous events. This chapter presents a scalable framework for building an effective and lightweight anomaly detection system. This framework includes three modules of capturing and logging, pre-processing and a new statistical decision engine, called the Dirichlet mixture model based anomaly detection technique. The first module sniffs and collects network data while the second module analyses and filters these data to improve the performance of the decision engine. Finally, the decision engine is designed based on the Dirichlet mixture model with a lower-upper interquartile range as decision engine. The performance of this framework is evaluated on two well-known datasets, the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. The empirical results showed that the statistical analysis of network data helps in choosing the best model which correctly fits the network data. Additionally, the Dirichlet mixture model based anomaly detection technique provides a higher detection rate and lower false alarm rate than other three compelling techniques. These techniques were built based on correlation and distance measures that cannot detect modern attacks which mimic normal activities, whereas the proposed technique was established using the Dirichlet mixture model and precise boundaries of interquartile range for finding small differences between legitimate and attack vectors, efficiently identifying these attacks.",

abstract="Machine Learning (ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) have become a promising tool to protect networks against cyberattacks. A wide range of datasets are publicly available and have been used for the development and evaluation of a large number of ML-based NIDS in the research community. However, since these NIDS datasets have very different feature sets, it is currently very difficult to reliably compare ML models across different datasets, and hence if they generalise to different network environments and attack scenarios. The limited ability to evaluate ML-based NIDSs has led to a gap between the extensive academic research conducted and the actual practical deployments in the real-world networks. This paper addresses this limitation, by providing five NIDS datasets with a common, practically relevant feature set, based on NetFlow. These datasets are generated from the following four existing benchmark NIDS datasets: UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, ToN-IoT, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. We have used the raw packet capture files of these datasets, and converted them to the NetFlow format, with a common feature set. The benefits of using NetFlow as a common format include its practical relevance, its wide deployment in production networks, and its scaling properties. The generated NetFlow datasets presented in this paper have been labelled for both binary- and multi-class traffic and attack classification experiments, and we have made them available for to the research community [1]. As a use-case and application scenario, the paper presents an evaluation of an Extra Trees ensemble classifier across these datasets.",

Because individual connections commonly exceed this speed, it is clear that existing systems violate the current specification. This document updates the specification of the IPv4 ID field in RFCs 791, 1122, and 2003 to more closely reflect current practice and to more closely match IPv6 so that the field's value is defined only when a datagram is actually fragmented.

TCP is an important transport-layer protocol in the Internet protocol stack, and it has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet. Over this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion. This document collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793. This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093, 6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793. It updates RFCs 1011 and 1122, and it should be considered as a replacement for the portions of those documents dealing with TCP requirements. It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state. The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168.},
